            <h2>It's nice to meet you, whoever is grading me!</h2>
            <p>Outside of this class, I work as an experience designer at a company called September Works.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2> What is <em>September Works</em>?</h2>
            <p> September Works is an <strong>experience design studio</strong> that consists of me,
                founder and creative director Thomas Ham, creative director Chris Edwards, experience designers
                Jamillia Lopez and Melissa Takai, as well as our studio manager Holly Moffat! Click <a href="https://www.september.works">here</a> to learn more about us.
            </p>
            <p>We like to say a lot of dumb things in the studio. One thing we enjoy saying is:</p>
            <q> Always follow your bliss...</q>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2> Here's a list of some dumb things we've done in the studio.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hosted a Mario Kart race in Figma.</li>
                <li>Roasted our founder Thomas Ham for his birthday (no, really).</li>
                <li>Hosted an Easter egg hunt in Figma which included eggs masked with Danny Devito's face. Those eggs were worth extra points.</li>
                <li>Kept a running tally of "strikes" before people would get fired (It was me. I kept the running tally.)</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Carefully place your hands around that cat.</li>
                <li>Squish that cat.</li>
                <li>????</li>
                <li>Profit off that cat.</li>

        <h2>Do you like dogs? Do you like parties?</h2>
        <p>My dog Yuna's birthday is on <time datetime="2022-07-24">July 24</time> and she'll be turning one!</p>
        <p>Here's my email address if you need to contact me about RSVPs to her birthday party:</p>

        <h2>A dumb thought.</h2>
        <p>I wish that there were functions in coding that sounded like animals. Like being asked to use <code>meowLoudly()</code> to make your cat speak.</p>
        <h2>Don't tell anyone this!</h2>
